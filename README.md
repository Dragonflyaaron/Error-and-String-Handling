# Error and String Handling
Programs for demonstrating how to handle errors, and practice using split and join methods for string handling.

## Description
### errors.py/erros2.py
For errors.py and errors2.py in the error folder.
I had to fix the errors present and using a '#' comment, describe the error type and why it's that.

### logig.py
For logic.py in errors folder.
Created a simple program that displays a logical error.

### optional_challenge.py
For optional_challenge.py
I Created a short program with two compilation errors, a runtime error and a logical error.
I explained with a comment what type of error it is and why it occurs.

### alternative.py
For alternative.py in string handling folder.
I played around with string functions to alter "Hello World".
I then utilized split() and join() methods to change the casefold by alternating words.

## Project Usage
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my abilities to work with errors and string handling, 
as part of the HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp and for potential recruiters.
